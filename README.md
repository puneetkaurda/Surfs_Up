# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the statistical analysis:

Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, analyze and visualize climate data as you prepare to open up a surf shop.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this challenge is to gather and analyze temperature data in Oahu for the months of June and December to see whether the surf shop will be sustainable year round.

## Results:

-The mean temperature of both months is warm and similar, with June being 74.94 and December being 71.04.
-The max temperatures are also very similar, with June being 85 and December being 83.
-The biggest difference between months is the minimum temperature. June's min temperature is 64, but December's is only 56.

## Summary:
An analysis on Oahu's weather could help determine whether seasons affect the surf and ice cream shop business in the island. In this analysis, I compared June and December data to describe summer and winter temperatures across a seven-year period. During this time period, both June and December had an average temperature of 75°F and and 71°F, respectively. June had a low temperature of 64°F and a high temperature of 85°F whereas December had a low temperature of 56°F and a high temperature of 83°F. In addition, both June and December had roughly similar standard deviations. June's standard deviation of 3.26 and December's standard deviation of 3.75 tells me that their temperature records are concentrated around both of their average temperatures. Lastly, June and December had a 75th percentile of 77°F and 74°F, respectively, which indicates that these two seasons had relatively warm temperatures.
